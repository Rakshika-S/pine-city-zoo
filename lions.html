                 <h3>LIONS</h3>
        <p>The lion (Panthera leo) is a large cat of the genus Panthera, native to Sub-Saharan Africa and India. 
            It has a muscular, broad-chested body; a short, rounded head; round ears; and a dark, hairy tuft at the tip of its tail.
             It is sexually dimorphic; adult male lions are larger than females and have a prominent mane. It is a social species, forming groups called prides.
              A lion's pride consists of a few adult males, related females, and cubs. Groups of female lions usually hunt together, preying mostly on medium-sized and large ungulates. 
              The lion is an apex and keystone predator.</p>    
         <p>The lion is a muscular, broad-chested cat with a short, rounded head, a reduced neck, and round ears; males have broader heads. The fur varies in colour from light buff to silvery grey,
             yellowish red, and dark brown. The colours of the underparts are generally lighter. A new-born lion has dark spots, which fade as the cub reaches adulthood, 
             although faint spots may still be seen on the legs and underparts.</p> 
             <p>The tail of all lions ends in a dark, hairy tuft that, in some lions, conceals an approximately 5 mm (0.20 in)-long, hard "spine" or "spur" composed of dermal papillae.
             The functions of the spur are unknown. The tuft is absent at birth, develops at around 5+1‚ÅÑ2 months of age and is readily identifiable at the age of seven months.</p>
