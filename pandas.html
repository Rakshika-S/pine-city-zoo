                 <h3>PANDAS</h3>
        <p>The giant panda is endemic to China. It is found in small, fragmented populations in six mountainous regions in the country,
             mainly in Sichuan, and also in neighbouring Shaanxi and Gansu.Successful habitat preservation has seen a rise in panda numbers,
              though loss of habitat due to human activities remains its biggest threat. In areas with a high concentration of medium-to-large-sized
             mammals—such as domestic cattle, a species known to degrade the landscape—the giant panda population is generally low. 
             This is mainly attributed to the panda's avoidance of interspecific competition.</p>
             <p>The giant panda has a body shape typical of bears. It has black fur on its ears, limbs, shoulders and around the eyes. 
                The rest of the animal's coat is white. The bear's distinctive coloration appears to serve as camouflage
             in both winter and summer environments as they do not hibernate. The white areas serve as camouflage in snow,
              while the black shoulders and legs conceal them in shade.</p>
              <p>Studies in the wild have found that when viewed from a distance, the panda displays disruptive coloration, 
                while up close, they rely more on blending in. The black ears may be used to display aggression,
                while the eye patches might facilitate them identifying one another. The giant panda's thick, 
                woolly coat keeps it warm in the cool forests of its habitat.</p>
