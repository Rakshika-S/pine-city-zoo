                 <h3>TIGERS</h3>
      <p>The tiger (Panthera tigris) is a large cat and a member of the genus Panthera native to Asia. 
        It has a powerful, muscular body with a large head and paws, a long tail and orange fur with black, 
        mostly vertical stripes. It is traditionally classified into nine recent subspecies, though some recognise only two subspecies,
         mainland Asian tigers and the island tigers of the Sunda Islands</p>
        <p>Tigers are normally silent but can produce numerous vocalisations. They roar to signal their presence to other individuals over long distances. 
            This vocalisation is forced through an open mouth as it closes and can be heard 3 km (1.9 mi) away. They roar multiple times in a row and others respond in kind. 
            Tigers also roar during mating and a mother will roar to call her cubs to her. When tense, tigers moan, a sound similar to a roar but softer and made when the mouth
             is at least partially closed. Moaning can be heard 400 m (1,300 ft) away.Aggressive encounters involve growling, snarling and hissing.</p>
             <p> An explosive "coughing roar" or "coughing snarl" is emitted through an open mouth and exposed teeth.[47][104][99] In friendlier situations, tigers prusten, a soft,
                 low-frequency snorting sound similar to purring in smaller cats. Tiger mothers communicate with their cubs by grunting, while cubs call back with miaows.
                 When startled, they "woof". They produce a deer-like "pok" sound for unknown reasons, but most often at kills.</p>
